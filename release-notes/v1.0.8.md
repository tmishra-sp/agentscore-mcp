## AgentScore MCP v1.0.8

This patch improves decision consistency for enterprise governance by separating tier recommendation from explicit access decisions.

### Highlights
- Added explicit `accessDecision` on each scored agent:
  - `ALLOW - STANDARD GUARDRAILS`
  - `CONDITIONAL - SUPERVISED ONLY`
  - `REJECT - DO NOT ONBOARD`
- Aligned high-stakes narrative wording with hard-stop risk signals so severe cases are clearly rejected.
- Kept output concise by showing a one-line decision summary with primary rationale (plus count of additional checks).

### Why this matters
- Prevents confusing cases where a broad recommendation label (for compatibility) appears softer than the actual go/no-go decision.
- Makes outputs easier to use in vendor review and PII/PHI access workflows.

### Validation
- `npm test` passing
- `npm run verify` passing
