## AgentScore MCP v1.0.7

This release finalizes the public-output hardening work so MCP responses stay enterprise-safe by default and do not leak public dashboard URLs.

### Highlights
- Removed public dashboard URL coupling from runtime scoring output:
  - removed `reportUrl` from score payloads
  - removed `AGENTSCORE_SITE_URL` and `AGENTSCORE_REPORT_URL_MODE`
- Kept output focused on governance artifacts that work in private environments:
  - `badge.url` and `badge.markdown`
  - `artifacts.governanceCardHtml`
- Added a defensive output sanitizer in `agentscore` tool text rendering to redact accidental `ai-agent-score.vercel.app` URLs.
- Improved enterprise thread sweep detection:
  - clustered timing heuristic for low-trust participants
  - elevated-risk cohort detection when multiple participants score below 550

### Validation
- `npm test` passing
- `npm run verify` passing
- `npm run benchmark:strict` passing
