## AgentScore MCP v1.0.6

This release makes enterprise output safer and more usable by default: no accidental dead public dashboard links, better badge interoperability, and ready-to-paste governance artifacts.

### Highlights
- Added enterprise JSON demo dataset:
  - `examples/enterprise-demo.json`
  - includes 4 business-focused agents and 1 thread for `sweep`
- Improved badge outputs for MCP/terminal clients:
  - added `badge.url` (plain clickable URL)
  - added `badge.markdown`
  - retained `badge.shields` for backward compatibility
- Added generated HTML governance artifact on each score:
  - `artifacts.governanceCardHtml`
  - included in MCP text output as a fenced `html` block
- Updated report-link policy defaults:
  - new default `AGENTSCORE_REPORT_URL_MODE=none`
  - optional overrides remain `demo-only` and `always`
  - default MCP text response no longer includes public `Report` links

### Validation
- `npm test` passing.
- `npm run verify` passing before tag push.
