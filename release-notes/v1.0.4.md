## AgentScore MCP v1.0.4

This release sharpens public readiness: clearer positioning/disclaimers, cleaner architecture communication, startup smoke validation, and stricter repository hygiene.

### Highlights
- Added explicit README sections for:
  - goal/audience/limits (decision-support disclaimer)
  - production proof checks (live GitHub + deterministic JSON dataset)
  - refreshed architecture diagram with clearer data/control flow
- Added CI smoke workflow (`.github/workflows/smoke.yml`) to verify:
  - package integrity (`npm pack --dry-run`)
  - MCP server startup behavior
- Hardened release workflow conditionals to avoid invalid `secrets.*` usage in `if:` checks.
- Added `.mcp.json` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commit of local/project MCP config.
- Updated contribution/release docs to reinforce PR-only-to-main and tag-only publishing.

### Validation
- `npm test` passing.
- `node test/public-contract.test.mjs` passing.
